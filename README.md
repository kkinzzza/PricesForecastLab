## Work Process Description

edit!!
*  **Data Preprocessing**: the distibution and characteristics of data were revealed.
*  **Models Selection**: 5 models from Scikit-learn library were selected for researching and training.
*  **Models Training**: selected models had been trained on the train dataset.
*  **Visualization**: every model training was followed by visualization of results – I got Precision, Recall and F1-Score metrics by classification reports, printed the Accuracy scores and drew Confusion Matrixes.
*  **Models Comparison**: models were compared by Accuracy and F1-Score, the most and least applicable models were revealed and the results were explained.
